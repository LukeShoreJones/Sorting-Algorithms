# Visual Sorts
Visual, customisable implementations of different sorting algorithms. An easy-to-use graphical user interface allows you to change the sorting algorithm used, the way the list is generated, the size of the list, the way it is represented and the delay between comparisons during sorting. These options make this program a fun, interactive way to study different sorting algorithms.

# User Guide
On Windows, run the Visual Sorts executable file. On other operating systems, you can run main.pyw directly, if you already have Python 3 installed.

The sliders on the right side of the user interface allow you to customise the sorting animation. The Reset button can be used to reroll the values to be sorted - this is necessary if you want to change the list type or size. For the other options, you can simply select the options you prefer and press Play to start sorting.

You will then be able to toggle between playing and pausing your sort animation with the same button. Select display options can be changed while your sort animation is playing or paused - to change the others, you will need to fully stop the sort with the Reset button.
