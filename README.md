# Sorting Algorithms
Visual, customisable implementations of different sorting algorithms. An easy-to-use graphical user interface allows you to change the sorting algorithm used, the way the list is generated, the size of the list, the way it is represented and the delay between comparisons during sorting. These options make this program a fun, interactive way to study different sorting algorithms.

# User Guide
Run main.py to run the program. You'll need Python 3 already installed.

# v1.0 Changelog
 - Program written. Pretty neat.

# What Did I Learn?
 - Brushed up on making GUIs with tkinter.
 - Using the grid effectively and organising widgets.
 - Implementing sorting algorithms in an unconventional way to allow for user input during sorting - each call of a sort function is one comparison.
